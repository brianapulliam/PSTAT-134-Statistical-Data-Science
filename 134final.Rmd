## Introduction

[![Image 1: CDC medical illustrator of COVID-19](germ.jpg){width="518"}](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/01/health/coronavirus-illustration-cdc.html)

The COVID-19 outbreak was a global public health emergency that affected people's lives all over the world. COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV2 virus that spread from person to person most commonly through droplet transmission. Once a person tested positive they could develop a variety of symptoms ranging from mild to severe ([WHO](https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus#tab=tab_1)). In an effort to slow the rapid spread, many public health officials called for stay at home orders which forced non-essential workers to shelter at home. The pandemic led to huge loss of life, increased poverty, and economic loss ([cite](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10408363.2020.1783198#abstract)). It was an event that lead the world to think about responsibility public health offices have when dealing with a pandemic.

### Why it Matters?

Although one might think the same measures were used throughout the entire country, every state in our country had the ability to implement their own measures to help curb the spread of the virus. States were allowed to determine testing sites, mask mandates, stay-at-home orders, isolation periods, etc. The differences across states had lasting impacts on the people living there. When research of state measures is conducted in combination with state data we can come see which states had lower positives tests. Did states with more restrictive measures have lower positive test? Hospitalizations? Deaths? How can we use state data in the event of another pandemic. Our project will compare the COVID-19 data for two states and see how their infection rates differed.

## Accessing Our Data

In order to access the data of interest, we used an API which provides access to national and state data regarding COVID-19. The initial website used is [Covid-API](https://covidtracking.com/data/api). This website is run by The COVID Tracking Project, a volunteer organization launched by The Atlantic that collected and published state data regarding the COVID-19 outbreak. This is an Open API, which means that itâ€™s open for public use. There were parameters available regarding specific dates as well as states, and while we're focused on the states of Alabama and Washington, we want to access all historic data on all available states.

We use the `GET` function access the API and store the response into `res`. `res` stores the data as Unicode so we convert it to a JOSN character list containing all our requested data.

```{r}
res <- GET("https://api.covidtracking.com/v1/states/daily.json")
states_data <- fromJSON(rawToChar(res$content))
```

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is an essential part of the analysis process. It gives us insight into the data we have at hand, identify possible problems, and allow us to see what we have to work with when it comes to our analysis. Initially we should look at the amount of variables within `states_data`.

```{r}
names(states_data)
```

Looking at this we can see there are 56 separate variables! This is a lot of different variables and we most likely will not need most of them, but it's important to see what they were and what they represent. When we look at the Covid Tracking Project website we can cross reference the variables and see what they represent and if they will be useful.

We can see from the figure above that there are 56 individual variables. Although there are many variables, not every single one will be useful for our analysis. When you reference the API access site and our `states_data` you're able to see all the variables are listed with a brief description of each one.

![](variables.jpg)

We can see that we have a variable representing each state, but upon further inspection we notice that it also includes US territories.

```{r}
unique(states_data$state)

```

We also know there is a variable regarding the dates of all the observations and from the API site we know there was data collection from January 2020 and March 2021. We do not know if each state and territory have the same amount of observations during this period.

```{r}
date_recorded <- states_data %>% 
  group_by(state) %>% 
  count() 

date_recorded %>% 
  kbl() %>%
  scroll_box(width = "300px", height = "400px")

date_recorded %>% 
  arrange(n)
  
  
```

```{r, fig.show='hold', out.width="50%"}

date_recorded %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
  head() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = state, y = n)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "dodgerblue") +
  labs(
    title = "6 States with highest observations", 
    x = "State", 
    y = "Observations"
  )

date_recorded %>%
  arrange(n) %>% 
  head() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = state, y = n)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "forestgreen") +
  labs(
    title = "6 States with lowest observations", 
    x = "State", 
    y = "Observations"
  )

```

Looking at these two graphs we can see the states that recorded the data the longest are Washington, Massachusetts, Florida, Virignia, Nebraska , and New Jersey. The states with the lowest observations are Alabama, American Samoa, Guam, Northern Marina Islands, Puerto Rico , and the Virgin Islands. It seems that Alabama reported is the lowest reporting state and the following would be US territories.

```{r, fig.show='hold', out.width="50%"}
death <- states_data %>% 
  group_by(state) %>% 
  filter(date == max(date)) %>% 
  select(state, death)

death %>% 
  arrange(desc(death)) %>% 
  head() %>% 
  ggplot(death, mapping = aes(x = reorder(state, -death), y = death)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") + theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    title = "Cumulative Deaths by State",
    x = "State",
    y = "Cumulative Deaths"
  )

death %>% 
  filter(!state %in% c("AS","GU","MP","VI", "VT")) %>% 
  arrange(desc(death)) %>% 
  tail() %>% 
  ggplot(death, mapping = aes(x = reorder(state, -death), y = death)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") + theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    title = "Cumulative Deaths by State",
    x = "State",
    y = "Cumulative Deaths"
  ) 

  
```

## Data Cleaning

After looking through the site and initially looking at the data we're able to remove a good chunk of variables that won't be of use. We also want to isolate the states we're interested in, Washington and Alabama.

```{r}
AL <- states_data %>% 
  filter(state == "AL") %>% 
  select(which(colMeans(is.na(.)) <= 0.35),"death",
         "recovered","onVentilatorCumulative",
         -state,-hash,-checkTimeEt,-dateChecked,
         -hospitalizedCurrently,-hospitalizedCumulative,
         -probableCases,-dateModified,-checkTimeEt,
         -lastUpdateEt,-negative)
AL <- AL %>% select_if(~ length(unique(.)) > 1)

WA <- states_data %>% 
  filter(state == "WA") %>% 
  select(which(colMeans(is.na(.)) <= 0.35),"death",
         "recovered",,"onVentilatorCumulative")
WA <- WA %>% select_if(~ length(unique(.)) > 1)

```

Brief Description

We want to compare the data sets to see what they have in common. From there we're able to isolate the common columns and make those are the ones included in the two individual data sets, `AL` and `WA`.

```{r}
common_columns <- intersect(names(AL), names(WA)) 
common_columns

# Subset each data frame to keep only the common columns
AL <- AL %>% select(all_of(common_columns))
WA <- WA %>% select(all_of(common_columns))

```

```{r}
vis_miss(AL)
```

```{r}
vis_miss(WA)
```

From the variables selected we can see there is a small portion of data missing from each data set. We want to have full data sets in order to analyze so we're going to use imputation to fill those missing values. In this case we're working on predictive mean matching (regression). Here we generate 5 imputed datasets and we take their averages to fill our missing values. It leads to a more robust imputation.

```{r, results='hide', warning=FALSE, cache=T}
set.seed(123)

imputed_AL <- mice(AL%>%select(-date), m = 5, method = 'pmm', maxit = 50, seed = 500)
AL_complete <- complete(imputed_AL)

imputed_WA <- mice(WA%>%select(-date), m = 5, method = 'pmm', maxit = 50, seed = 500)
WA_complete <- complete(imputed_WA)


```

```{r}
AL_complete$date <- AL$date
WA_complete$date <- WA$date
WA_complete <- WA_complete %>% drop_na(positive, positiveCasesViral)

vis_miss(AL_complete)
vis_miss(WA_complete)
names(WA_complete)
ncol(AL_complete)
nrow(AL_complete)
ncol(WA_complete)
nrow(WA_complete)

```

```{r}
WA$date %>% tail()%>% kable()
AL$date %>% tail() %>% kable()
```

From here we can see that `AL` has 366 entries while `WA` has 420. We want to have an even comparison so we will find the date for `WA` starts on January 14, 2020 while `AL` starts on March 7th, 2020.

```{r}
# Convert date column to Date format
AL_complete$date <- as.Date(as.character(AL_complete$date), format = "%Y%m%d")
WA_complete$date <- as.Date(as.character(WA_complete$date), format = "%Y%m%d")

# Set the baseline date
baseline_date <- as.Date("2020-01-01")

# Compute days since the baseline date
AL_complete$daysSinceStart <- as.numeric(AL_complete$date - baseline_date)
WA_complete$daysSinceStart <- as.numeric(WA_complete$date - baseline_date)
```

#### Correlation Plot

```{r, side-by-side-plots, fig.show="hold", fig.width=4, fig.height=4}
library(corrr)
library(corrplot)
AL_corr <- AL_complete %>% 
  select(-date) %>% 
  cor() %>% 
  corrplot(type = "lower", diag = F)

WA_corr <- WA_complete %>% 
  select(-date) %>% 
  cor() %>% 
  corrplot(type = "lower", diag = F)

  
```

```{r}
# Deaths Over Time Visualization

# Plot for Alabama
ggplot(AL_complete, aes(x = daysSinceStart, y = death)) +
  geom_line(color = "blue") +
  labs(title = "Deaths Over Time (Alabama)", 
       x = "Days Since Jan 1, 2020", y = "Deaths") +
  theme_minimal()

# Plot for Washington
ggplot(WA_complete, aes(x = daysSinceStart, y = death)) +
  geom_line(color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Deaths Over Time (Washington)", 
       x = "Days Since Jan 1, 2020", y = "Deaths") +
  theme_minimal()

```

## Model Fitting

```{r}
# Fit the GAM for the AL_complete data using the selected variables from LASSO
gam_AL <- gam(death ~ s(positive) + s(totalTestResults) + s(hospitalized) + 
                      s(positiveCasesViral) +
                      s(daysSinceStart), 
              data = AL_complete, 
              family = poisson())
summary(gam_AL)
# Plot the smooths
plot(gam_AL, pages = 1, residuals = TRUE, rug = TRUE)
# Check GAM diagnostics
gam.check(gam_AL)
# Plot residuals vs fitted
plot(gam_AL$residuals ~ gam_AL$fitted.values, 
     xlab = "Fitted Values", ylab = "Residuals", main = "Residuals vs Fitted")
abline(h = 0, col = "red")


```

```{r}
# Fit the GAM for the WA_complete data using the selected variables from LASSO
gam_WA <- gam(death ~ s(daysSinceStart) + s(positive) + s(total) + s(positiveIncrease), 
              data = WA_complete, 
              family = poisson())

summary(gam_WA)
# Plot the smooths
plot(gam_WA, pages = 1, residuals = TRUE, rug = TRUE)
# Check GAM diagnostics
gam.check(gam_WA)
# Plot residuals vs fitted
plot(gam_WA$residuals ~ gam_WA$fitted.values, 
     xlab = "Fitted Values", ylab = "Residuals", main = "Residuals vs Fitted")
abline(h = 0, col = "red")

```

### Training and Testing

#### Alabama

```{r}
AL_train_index <- sample(1:nrow(AL_complete), size = 0.7 * nrow(AL_complete)) # 70% training
AL_train_data <- AL_complete[AL_train_index, ]
AL_test_data <- AL_complete[-AL_train_index, ]

trained_gam_AL <- gam(death ~ s(positive) + s(totalTestResults) + s(hospitalized) + 
                s(positiveCasesViral) + s(deathIncrease) +
                s(daysSinceStart), data = AL_train_data) 
              
AL_predictions <- predict(trained_gam_AL, newdata = AL_test_data)
```

```{r}
# Mean Squared Error (MSE)
mse <- mean((AL_test_data$death - AL_predictions)^2)

# Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
rmse <- sqrt(mse)

# Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
mae <- mean(abs(AL_test_data$death - AL_predictions))

# Print results
print(list(MSE = mse, RMSE = rmse, MAE = mae))

```

```{r}
# Plot of Actual and Predicted Deaths in Alabama over Time
plot_data <- data.frame(
  daysSinceStart = AL_test_data$daysSinceStart,
  Actual = AL_test_data$death,
  Predicted = AL_predictions
)


ggplot(plot_data, aes(x = daysSinceStart)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = Actual, color = "Actual"), size = 1) +
  geom_line(aes(y = Predicted, color = "Predicted"), size = 1) +
  labs(title = "Actual vs Predicted Deaths Over Time (Alabama)", 
       x = "Days Since Jan 1, 2020", y = "Deaths") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Actual" = "blue", "Predicted" = "red")) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.title = element_blank())

```

#### Washington

```{r}
WA_train_index <- sample(1:nrow(WA_complete), size = 0.7 * nrow(WA_complete)) # 70% training
WA_train_data <- WA_complete[WA_train_index, ]
WA_test_data <- WA_complete[-WA_train_index, ]

trained_gam_WA <- gam(death ~ s(positive) + s(total) + s(daysSinceStart), 
                      data = WA_train_data) 

WA_predictions <- predict(trained_gam_WA, newdata = WA_test_data)
```

```{r}
# Mean Squared Error (MSE)
WA_mse <- mean((WA_test_data$death - WA_predictions)^2)

# Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
WA_rmse <- sqrt(WA_mse)

# Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
WA_mae <- mean(abs(WA_test_data$death - WA_predictions))

# Print results
print(list(MSE = WA_mse, RMSE = WA_rmse, MAE = WA_mae))
```

```{r}
# Plot of Actual and Predicted Deaths in WASHINGTON over Time
WA_plot_data <- data.frame(
  daysSinceStart = WA_test_data$daysSinceStart,
  Actual = WA_test_data$death,
  Predicted = WA_predictions
)


ggplot(WA_plot_data, aes(x = daysSinceStart)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = Actual, color = "Actual"), size = 1) +
  geom_line(aes(y = Predicted, color = "Predicted"), size = 1) +
  labs(title = "Actual vs Predicted Deaths Over Time (Washington)", 
       x = "Days Since Jan 1, 2020", y = "Deaths") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Actual" = "blue", "Predicted" = "red")) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.title = element_blank())
